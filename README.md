Introduction & Learning Goals
-----------------------------

Turn an idea into a world. This workshop is a rapid-fire introduction to making 3D environments from scratch with Blender. We will take an artist-friendly approach as we walk through a variety of tools and workflows. Building a world does not have to be complicated!

We will start with an intro to super-simple 3D modeling and create few basic props. Then, we will look ways to make Blender do the hard work of spawning and arranging props for us. And finally, after we've built up the frame of our world, we can add style, create colorful and funky materials, import photos, and make our world nice!

Participants will learn to:
- Navigate Blender's Interface
- Model basic 3D objects
- Use modifiers to generate and populate a scene
- Add style with materials
- Render and save images
- Use shaders to dive even deeper


Prerequisite / Background knowledge
-----------------------------------

This workshop assumes no prior experience with Blender. Some familiarity with digital 3D space will be a plus, but not needed.
This workshop is meant to to share artist-friendly tips

Using a 3-button mouse is strongly recommended, but a trackpad in bed will also work (we've all been there)
